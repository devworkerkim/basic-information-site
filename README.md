# Basic Informational Site | The Odin Project

This is the repo for the Basic Informational Site project in the NodeJS course of The Odin Project.  The objective was to build a NodeJS server with some pages to be served given the URL.

## What I Learned

This was a simple project to get familiar with setting up a NodeJS server.  I followed along the [Node.js Crash Course Tutorial #4 - Requests & Responses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQD00NAUPNk&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jsz4LDYc6kv3ymONOKxwBU&index=4) from The Net Ninja and created the routes and pages needed to serve the project.

### Adding Express

Continuing with the course, the assignment in the Introduction To Express lesson had me rewrite project using Express.  With the help of Express, a lot of the details in NodeJS have been abstracted away and the code simplified to using a few `app.get()` statements.  To correctly read the file to be sent, the path module from NodeJS was added.
